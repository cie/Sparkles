Hey! This is my collection of interactive visualizations for Maths and Physics. Browse the directories to find something interesting. Some of them are in Hungarian, and many lack documentation. Sorry for that.

## Software

The following software is used:

* [Processing](http://processing.org/)
* [GeoGebra](http://www.geogebra.org/)

## Licencs

All these software are released under MIT licence.

## Interested?

If you like one of the visualizations, need help, explanation, or want to develop them further, feel free to contact me in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/cie/Sparkles/issues) or by email (kallo.bernat). (gmail). (com).
